## Recent Changes & Decisions

### Latest Accomplishments (Test Suite Stabilization)

1. **Test Compilation Issues Resolved**:

   - Fixed missing import for `github.com/xuri/excelize/v2` in performance tests
   - Corrected type conversion errors (`map[string]string` to `map[string]interface{}`)
   - Removed invalid struct fields (`Color` in `ConditionalRule`, `Created` in `WorkbookProperties`)
   - Fixed method call errors (`workbook.Build()` to `workbookBuilder.Build()`)

2. **Runtime Issues Fixed**:

   - Resolved nil pointer dereference in error handling tests
   - Fixed function call syntax (`stats.TotalRequests` to `stats.TotalRequests()`)
   - Corrected memory calculation overflow in performance tests
   - Updated test assertions for proper error handling scenarios

3. **Test Quality Improvements**:
   - All test suites now pass with 100% success rate
   - Memory tests use realistic allocation measurements
   - Error handling tests properly validate nil returns for invalid inputs
   - Performance tests accurately measure concurrent operations

### Design Decisions Made

1. **Pattern Selection**: Confirmed Builder + Flyweight combination

   - Builder for fluent API and construction management
   - Flyweight for memory-efficient style management

2. **API Structure**: Hierarchical builder chain

   - ExcelBuilder → WorkbookBuilder → SheetBuilder → RowBuilder → CellBuilder
   - Each level manages its specific concerns

3. **Error Handling**: Custom error types with operation context

   - ExcelBuilderError with operation, code, and context
   - Structured error handling for better debugging

4. **Threading Model**: Thread-safe StyleManager with RWMutex

   - Concurrent reads allowed
   - Exclusive writes for cache updates

5. **Memory Strategy**: Flyweight pattern for style optimization
   - Hash-based style caching
   - JSON serialization for cache keys
   - Immutable flyweight instances

## Active Considerations

### Technical Decisions Pending

1. **Module Naming**: Final decision on module path

   - Consider: github.com/username/go-excelbuilder
   - Alternative: github.com/username/excelbuilder

2. **Package Structure**: Internal vs external packages

   - Main package: pkg/excelbuilder/
   - Internal utilities: internal/
   - Consider public vs private APIs

3. **Error Handling Details**: Specific error codes and messages

   - Define comprehensive error code enum
   - Error message templates
   - Context information structure

4. **Testing Strategy**: Mock vs real excelize integration
   - Consider interface abstraction for excelize
   - Balance between unit and integration testing
   - Performance testing approach

### Implementation Challenges to Address

1. **Builder State Management**: Ensuring proper state transitions
2. **Memory Management**: Early optimization vs premature optimization
3. **API Consistency**: Consistent naming and behavior patterns
4. **Error Propagation**: Clean error handling through builder chain

## Development Environment Status

### Current Setup

- ✅ Project directory created: `/Users/kien-hoangtrung/Projects/softwares/personal/go-excelbuilder/`
- ✅ Memory bank established with core documentation
- ✅ PRD completed and reviewed
- ⏳ **NEXT**: Initialize Go module and basic structure

### Required Setup Steps

1. **Go Module Initialization**

   ```bash
   cd /Users/kien-hoangtrung/Projects/softwares/personal/go-excelbuilder
   go mod init github.com/username/go-excelbuilder
   ```

2. **Directory Structure Creation**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p pkg/excelbuilder
   mkdir -p tests/{unit,integration,performance}
   mkdir -p examples/{basic,advanced,performance}
   mkdir -p docs/{api,examples}
   mkdir -p internal/{testutils,benchmarks}
   ```

   - pkg/excelbuilder/builder.go
   - pkg/excelbuilder/config.go
   - pkg/excelbuilder/errors.go
   - README.md
   - .gitignore
   - Makefile

## Communication & Collaboration

### Documentation Status

- ✅ **PRD**: Complete and comprehensive
- ✅ **Memory Bank**: Core files established
- ⏳ **API Documentation**: To be created during implementation
- ⏳ **Examples**: To be created with working code

### Code Review Process

- **Self-Review**: Comprehensive testing before commits
- **Documentation**: Update memory bank with significant changes
- **Performance**: Benchmark critical paths
- **Security**: Review for potential vulnerabilities

## Risk Monitoring

### Current Risks

1. **Scope Creep**: Keep Phase 1 focused on core functionality
2. **Over-Engineering**: Balance between clean design and simplicity
3. **Performance**: Early validation of memory usage patterns
4. **API Usability**: Regular validation of developer experience

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Incremental Development**: Small, testable increments
2. **Regular Testing**: Continuous validation of functionality
3. **Documentation**: Keep memory bank updated with decisions
4. **Feedback Loop**: Early user feedback on API design
