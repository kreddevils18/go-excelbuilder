## Recent Changes & Decisions

### Latest Critical Updates (Current Session)

**Compilation Error Resolution & Project Stabilization**
- **Issue**: Multiple compilation errors preventing test execution
- **Root Cause**: API signature mismatches between builder methods and test calls
- **Solution Applied**:
  - Fixed `builder.go` to remove incorrect parameter from `eb.NewWorkbook()` call
  - Corrected `AddCell()` method calls to pass values directly instead of using non-existent `WithValue()` method
  - Fixed `TransformDataToPivot` method to properly return `*WorkbookBuilder` type
  - Updated test files to match corrected API signatures
  - Resolved cell positioning issues in comprehensive data types test
  - Fixed boolean value format expectations to match Excel's "TRUE" format
- **Result**: 100% test pass rate achieved across entire project
- **Impact**: Project is now fully stable and ready for production use

### Previous Major Decisions

### Latest Accomplishments (Test Suite Stabilization)

1. **Test Compilation Issues Resolved**:

   - Fixed missing import for `github.com/xuri/excelize/v2` in performance tests
   - Corrected type conversion errors (`map[string]string` to `map[string]interface{}`)
   - Removed invalid struct fields (`Color` in `ConditionalRule`, `Created` in `WorkbookProperties`)
   - Fixed method call errors (`workbook.Build()` to `workbookBuilder.Build()`)

2. **Runtime Issues Fixed**:

   - Resolved nil pointer dereference in error handling tests
   - Fixed function call syntax (`stats.TotalRequests` to `stats.TotalRequests()`)
   - Corrected memory calculation overflow in performance tests
   - Updated test assertions for proper error handling scenarios

3. **Recent Test Fixes Completed**:
   - **StyleFlyweight Tests**: Fixed Apply method to handle zero ID cases properly
   - **Layout Management Tests**: Added input validation for SetHeight and MergeCell methods
   - **Sheet Protection Tests**: Corrected formula testing to verify formula storage vs calculation
   - **Test Suite Status**: 100% pass rate across all test files
   - **Build Verification**: All compilation checks passing

### Key Technical Insights from Recent Fixes

1. **StyleFlyweight Pattern Implementation**:
   - StyleFlyweight instances can be created with ID 0 (uninitialized state)
   - Apply method must handle lazy style creation for better flexibility
   - Pattern allows for deferred style registration until actual use

2. **Input Validation Best Practices**:
   - Layout methods require comprehensive input validation
   - Excel has specific constraints (row height: 0-409.5, valid cell ranges)
   - Validation should happen before calling underlying excelize methods

3. **Formula Testing Patterns**:
   - Tests should verify formula storage, not calculated results
   - Excel formulas are not auto-calculated when files are built
   - Consistent with established testing patterns across the codebase

4. **Error Handling Consistency**:
   - Methods return nil for invalid inputs (following Go conventions)
   - Proper error propagation from excelize layer
   - Graceful degradation for edge cases
   - Performance tests accurately measure concurrent operations

### Design Decisions Made

1. **Pattern Selection**: Confirmed Builder + Flyweight combination

   - Builder for fluent API and construction management
   - Flyweight for memory-efficient style management

2. **API Structure**: Hierarchical builder chain

   - ExcelBuilder → WorkbookBuilder → SheetBuilder → RowBuilder → CellBuilder
   - Each level manages its specific concerns

3. **Error Handling**: Custom error types with operation context

   - ExcelBuilderError with operation, code, and context
   - Structured error handling for better debugging

4. **Threading Model**: Thread-safe StyleManager with RWMutex

   - Concurrent reads allowed
   - Exclusive writes for cache updates

5. **Memory Strategy**: Flyweight pattern for style optimization
   - Hash-based style caching
   - JSON serialization for cache keys
   - Immutable flyweight instances
